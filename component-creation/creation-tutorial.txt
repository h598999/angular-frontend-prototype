Components are angular building blocks. Components contains:
- code
- html
- css styling
a component can contain other components

In Angular components have metadata that define its properties:
 selector: how it is referred to component in templates
 standalone: to describe whether th component require NgModule
 imports
 template the components html layout
 styleUrls: used to list the url of the css files that the
 component uses in an array

use this command to create a component:
  ng generate component home --inline-template --skip-tests
this will create a new component called home.

.
├── app.component.css
├── app.component.ts
└── home
    ├── home.component.css
    └── home.component.ts

this is the created component:

import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-home',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [],
  template: `
    <p>
      home works!
    </p>
  `,
  styleUrl: './home.component.css'
})
export class HomeComponent {

}

to include this component in another in this case AppComponent
we need to add this import line in app.component.ts

import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component';

you then need to update @Component imports field to include HomeComponent

then alter the @Component template fields html to reference <app-home></app-home>

Adding features to HomeComponent
You just alter the home.component.ts and home.component.css
