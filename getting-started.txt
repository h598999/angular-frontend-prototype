Components define areas of responsibility in the UI
This allows you to reuse frontend components.

A component consists of three things a class(js?), a template(html), component specific
styles(css)

Example:
app-root is the first component to load and is responsible for loading other components
app-top-bar the store name and checkout button
app-product-list The product list
app-product-alerts A component that contains the application's alerts
