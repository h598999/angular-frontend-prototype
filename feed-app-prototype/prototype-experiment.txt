The goal is to create a basic prototype for the frontend of the
feed-app.

The funtionality includes:
 - a way to see all polls
 - to see a poll given an id

We want to measure time used to create this basic functionality
using three different frameworks. We measure effeciency in time
and lines of code.

None of the group memebers have experience with angular, but some members
have experience with vue and react. Meaning it will naturally be used more time
on angular, but this is part of the problem habitat.

Time started developing angular components: 14:50
