The pupeteer metrics api returns 13 different metrics but the most important are:

ScriptDuration: The amount of time in milliseconds how much time the browser spen on javscript
parsing and executing. If numbers here are really big this means yhat you have either alot
of javascript on th epage or it runs very slowly. For low performance devices a huge amount of 
javascript can be a huge disaster because parsing javascript uses alot of cpu.

LayoutDuration: The amount of time in millisexonds how much time the browser spent on construction
layout. If it starts rapidly growing, this signalizws that your markup is overcomplicated big.

JSHeapUsedSize: The amount of memory in bytes the application is using. Again, this is important fort
the cheap mobiles that have a little amount of memory. If you are targeting this audience this 
metric is crucial for you.

LayoutDuration: The amount of memory in bytes the application is using. Again, this is
important for the cheap mobiles that have less memory. 

First contentful paint. 

The first contentful Paint is part of the Web Vitals performanve events and indicates when a user
starts seeing any part og the content.

Recommended value is 1.8 seconds. To get this metric we will use the browsers performance API



Largest Contentful Paint measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading.
First Input Delay: measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have an FID of less than 100 milliseconds.
Cumulative Layout Shift: measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1.
